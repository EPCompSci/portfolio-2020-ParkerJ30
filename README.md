## About Me
Hello, I am Parker Johnson. I am currently a Senior at Eden Prairie Highschool. In this portofolio I showcase some of the apps that I made in APCSP last year, and what I am currently making in IOS. Later this year I am scheduled to take AP Java and will further my knowledge with that.  Next year I am going to further develop my understand in computer science atthe University of Minnesota CSE program.

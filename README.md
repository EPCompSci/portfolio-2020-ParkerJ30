# iOS-Portfolio
2020-2021 Portfolio

## About Me
Hello, I am Parker Johnson. I am currently a Senior at Eden Prairie Highschool. In this portofolio I showcase some of the apps that I made in APCSP, and IOS. Later this year I am scheduled to take AP Java and will further my knowledge with that.  Next year I am going to further develop my understanding in computer science at the University of Minnesota CSE program.

## Projects




[Break the Block Game](https://github.com/ParkerJ30/Break-the-Block-game) 

![BreakeBlock UI](https://github.com/ParkerJ30/Break-the-Block-game/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202020-11-05%20at%2010.19.15%20AM.png)

This was the first app I created by myself in APCSP. The picture above show cases one of the three leves in the game. In this game you use your finger to drag the rectangle along the screen and use it as a trampoline. A ball will fly around and you have to keep it from hitting the bottom by using the trampoline. As the ball bounces around it will destroy the mines in this level. Once all the mines are broken you win the game. This was one of the first games I learned to use sprites. It was a little complicated to get the ball to move randomly and for it to react to the other sprites by bouncing off of them. But eventually I got it and it was a great achievment for me using sprites. I created this app using MIT App Inventor.


[1942 Airplane Game](https://github.com/ParkerJ30/Airplane-1942-game)

This was the second game I created by myself in APCSP. This game was based off of the arcade game 1942. In this game you control the plane on the bottom screen and you can move it back and forth. In addition to this you also have a shoot button that shoots missles to the oncoming planes. The oncoming plane appears at the top of the screen, you try to shoot this plane down and if it hits the bottom of the screen you lose. This app even further developed my understanding of sprites and how to control them and how to react to each other. In additon I learned how to use CloudDps which I used in enable to keep track of the highscore and save it when the app is closed out.  I created this app using MIT App Inventor.

[Code Organizor APP](https://github.com/ParkerJ30/Code-Organize-App)

This app was the first app that I created using swift in Xcode. I created this app in order to input my exisiting code in so I wouldnt have to relearn how to do everything. In this app I learned how to use tab and scroll views. I also learned how to switch pages and create icons for the app. I learned this code mostly by searching it up and using apple developer. Overall I was really proud of this app and really helped me understand the basics of swift.

[EPHS APP](https://github.com/connorholm/ephsapp2020)

This is the final app I that I helped create in IOS using the swift language. I was on a team with 5 other people to create this app: @AdrianColaianni @connorholm @rachelPark1 @jackgsch @jmblanco22 . This app was created to assist EPHS students. This app takes each individual students api keys from their Schoology page to portray specific information for them. This app is also offically on the appstore underneath the name EPHS.
- The first tab in this app allows users to view their classes and what assignments they have completed in each class. This tab uses schoologys api to recieve this information and then portray it for each individual students so the information is specialized specifically for them. 
- It allows the user to view announcments their teachers have made from their schoology course. Once again this uses Schoologys api to get this information for each specific student.
- It has an easily accesible menu tab that has buttons that when pressed leads the user to a webview cordinating to the button they press. Some examples are the EPHS campus login, Eagle Vision News, registration for counselor appointments, etc.
- It has a tab that allows the user to view their grades as they appear on schoology. It lists the class and the percent grade of the class. This also uses Schoologys api to get the information for each individual student.

Additonal Features:
- Has a timer that portrays how much time is left in each hour and what hour we are in. It also changes based on what day it is to follow the correct schedule. 
- Has an optional guest login option instead of allowing their user to use their own api keys to get their own information. This limits their options on what they an use on the app but still allows basic features such as the website links.

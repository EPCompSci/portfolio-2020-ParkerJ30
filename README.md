2020-2021 Portfolio

## About Me!
Hello, I am Parker Johnson. I am currently a Senior at Eden Prairie Highschool. In this portofolio I showcase some of the apps that I made in APCSP last year, and what I am currently making in IOS. Later this year I am scheduled to take AP Java and will further my knowledge with that.  Next year I am going to further develop my understand in computer science atthe University of Minnesota CSE program.

Using this space as the home base for your portfolio, make a wiki or pages like this read me to highlight what you have learned / created over this semester of class. You should consider this as much for your grade as your resume. You've got incredible work to highlight and brag about - do that here. 

I'd like you to consider this assignment as a way to get a job / internship / independent contract with someone outside the school.

Create links to group projects (create a new repo for completed apps) you've been working on, making sure the read me's have details about what the apps do in the format the app store asks - look at a couple apps to see what I'm talking about. Don't forget about those first simple apps you created - they still matter!

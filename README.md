2020-2021 Portfolio

## About Me
Hello, I am Parker Johnson. I am currently a Senior at Eden Prairie Highschool. In this portofolio I showcase some of the apps that I made in APCSP last year, and what I am currently making in IOS. Later this year I am scheduled to take AP Java and will further my knowledge with that.  Next year I am going to further develop my understand in computer science atthe University of Minnesota CSE program.

## Projects




[Break the Block Game](https://github.com/ParkerJ30/Break-the-Block-game)

This was the first app I created by myself in APCSP. The picture above show cases one of the three leves in the game. In this game you use your finger to drag the rectangle along the screen and use it as a trampoline. A ball will fly around and you have to keep it from hitting the bottom by using the trampoline. As the ball bounces around it will destroy the mines in this level. Once all the mines are broken you win the game. This was one of the first games I learned to use sprites. It was a little complicated to get the ball to move randomly and for it to react to the other sprites by bouncing off of them. But eventually I got it and it was a great achievment for me using sprites.

This was the second game I created by myself in APCSP. This game was based off of the arcade game 1942. In this game you control the plane on the bottom screen and you can move it back and forth. In addition to this you also have a shoot button that shoots missles to the oncoming planes. The oncoming plane appears at the top of the screen, you try to shoot this plane down and if it hits the bottom of the screen you lose. This app even further developed my understanding of sprites and how to control them and how to react to each other. In additon I learned how to use CloudDps which I used in enable to keep track of the highscore and save it when the app is closed out.

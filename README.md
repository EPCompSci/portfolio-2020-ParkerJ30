2020-2021 Portfolio

## About Me
Hello, I am Parker Johnson. I am currently a Senior at Eden Prairie Highschool. In this portofolio I showcase some of the apps that I made in APCSP, and IOS. Later this year I am scheduled to take AP Java and will further my knowledge with that.  Next year I am going to further develop my understanding in computer science at the University of Minnesota CSE program.

## Projects




[Break the Block Game](https://github.com/ParkerJ30/Break-the-Block-game)

This was the first app I created by myself in APCSP. The picture above show cases one of the three leves in the game. In this game you use your finger to drag the rectangle along the screen and use it as a trampoline. A ball will fly around and you have to keep it from hitting the bottom by using the trampoline. As the ball bounces around it will destroy the mines in this level. Once all the mines are broken you win the game. This was one of the first games I learned to use sprites. It was a little complicated to get the ball to move randomly and for it to react to the other sprites by bouncing off of them. But eventually I got it and it was a great achievment for me using sprites. I created this app using MIT App Inventor.


[1942 Airplane Game](https://github.com/ParkerJ30/Airplane-1942-game)

This was the second game I created by myself in APCSP. This game was based off of the arcade game 1942. In this game you control the plane on the bottom screen and you can move it back and forth. In addition to this you also have a shoot button that shoots missles to the oncoming planes. The oncoming plane appears at the top of the screen, you try to shoot this plane down and if it hits the bottom of the screen you lose. This app even further developed my understanding of sprites and how to control them and how to react to each other. In additon I learned how to use CloudDps which I used in enable to keep track of the highscore and save it when the app is closed out.  I created this app using MIT App Inventor.

[Code Organizor APP](https://github.com/ParkerJ30/Code-Organize-App)

This app was the first app that I created using swift in Xcode. I created this app in order to input my exisiting code in so I wouldnt have to relearn how to do everything. In this app I learned how to use tab and scroll views. I also learned how to switch pages and create icons for the app. I learned this code mostly by searching it up and using apple developer. Overall I was really proud of this app and really helped me understand the basics of swift.

[EPHS APP](https://github.com/connorholm/EPHS-App)

This App is the project I am currently working on. It allows students at EPHS to access their assignments, their clubs, and have easy access links to other EPHS websites. We are using schoology's API to put the assignmnets into the app. We are also having live timer that counts the time of class left, which is eventually gonna become a widget. This is a large app and its going to take a very long time but it is very fun to create and the results will be worth the effort.
